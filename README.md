QGenie is a web application that uses GPT-oriented AI Technology to generate exam questions for UK A Level subjects (GCSE Soon). It is a freemium service, and currently is heavily experimental.

## How it works

QGenie uses a fine-tuned large-language model (LLM) and hosts on an API to be able for users to generate specific, unique and original exam style questions, in the style they would see it in the real exam.

## How to use

To use QGenie, simply go to [qgenie.co.uk](qgenie.co.uk)!
